# üéì SmartForm ‚Äì An AI-Driven Bicep Curl Counter Using Computer Vision

## üìñ Introduction

**SmartForm** is an innovative application of computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) in the domain of fitness and human pose tracking. The system is designed to recognize, analyze, and count bicep curl repetitions in real-time using a webcam and without requiring any physical contact or wearable sensors. It aims to provide a cost-effective and accessible alternative to traditional personal training methods and smart gym equipment.

## üéØ Project Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

* To develop a vision-based system capable of accurately detecting and analyzing human motion during bicep curls.
* To calculate elbow joint angles using body landmarks for identifying repetition stages.
* To automate repetition counting and provide live visual feedback to the user.
* To enhance the user‚Äôs form awareness, promoting safer and more effective exercise routines.

## üß™ Methodology

1. **Pose Estimation with MediaPipe**
   The system utilizes **MediaPipe Pose**, a machine learning-based pose estimation framework developed by Google, which detects 33 key body landmarks from a video frame.

2. **Joint Angle Calculation**
   Using the detected coordinates of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, the elbow angle is computed using vector mathematics and trigonometric functions. The angle is used as the primary metric for analyzing the bicep curl movement.

3. **Repetition Counting Logic**

   * When the elbow angle exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 160¬∞), the system interprets the motion as the **"down"** phase of the curl.
   * When the angle drops below a threshold (e.g., 30¬∞), it marks the **"up"** phase.
   * A valid transition from "down" to "up" is counted as one complete repetition.

4. **Real-Time Feedback and Visualization**
   Visual feedback is provided directly on the video feed, including:

   * The numerical elbow angle at each frame.
   * The current stage of the motion (up/down).
   * The total repetition count.
